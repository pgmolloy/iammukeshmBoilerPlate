## Problem It will Solve

The Basic Idea is to save hours of development time. The users should be able to start off from the point all the technical aspects are already covered. The only thhing we need to worry is about implementing the Business Logic. I am planning this Project to have 2 realms - A Fluid UI Based ASP.NET Core 3.1 Razor Project and a WebAPI Project that provided data to public via valid JWT.
